			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> Obstacles, Difficulties</li>
			<li class="a">Obstacles don't block the path. They are the path. <br> - Zen Proverb</li>

			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> 21<sup>st</sup> century</li>
			<li class="a">You should sit in meditation for 20 minutes a day unless you're too busy. Then you should sit for an hour. <br>- An old Zen saying</li>

			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> If you wish to see the Truth then hold no opinion.</li>
			<li class="a">The Great Way is not difficult for those who have no preferences. When love and hate are both absent everything becomes clear and undisguised. Make the smallest distinction, however, and heaven and earth are set infinitely apart. If you wish to see the truth then hold no opinion for or against. The struggle of what one likes and what one dislikes is the disease of the mind. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinxin_Ming" target="_blank">- Sengstan</a>, Xinxin Ming </li>

			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> "Be water my friend."</li>
			<li class="a">Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless... Like water. Now you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup, You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle, You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend. <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJMwBwFj5nQ" target="_blank">- Bruce Lee</a></li> 

			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> Time is much more than Money</li>
			<li class="a">Many people cannot allow themselves the time to sit and do nothing, but breathe. They consider it to be uneconomical or luxury. People say "time is money". But time is much more than money. Time is life. The simple practice of sitting quietly on a regular basis can be profoundly healing. Stopping and sitting is a good way to focus on mindful breathing and nothing else. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh" target="_blank">- Thích Nhất Hạnh</a>, Zen master</li>

			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> Stillness is strenght</li>
			<li class="a">If we are not calm, we can't listen deeply and understand. But when our mind is calm, we can see reality more clearly, like still water reflecting the trees, the clouds and the blue sky. Stillness is the foundation of understanding and insight. Stillness is strenght. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Nh%E1%BA%A5t_H%E1%BA%A1nh" target="_blank">- Thích Nhất Hạnh</a>, Zen master</li>

			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> Zazen</li>
			<li class="a">In zazen, leave your front door and your back door open. Let thoughts come and go. Just don't serve them tea.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunry%C5%AB_Suzuki" target="_blank">- Shunryu Suzuki</a></li>
			
			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> "Knock on the sky and listen to the sound"</li>
			<li class="a">- Zen Proverb</li>

			<li class="q"><img src="img/arrow.png"> When you think it is... It is not!</li>
			<li class="a">Don't think. Feel!</li>
